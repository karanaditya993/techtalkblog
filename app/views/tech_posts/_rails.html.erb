  <p>It is an advanced programmers nightmare when they hear the words, "Is Ruby on Rails the same thing as Ruby?". To many, the two go hand-in-hand and are said to be the same thing. The truth is, they are NOT! This tech blog serves to answer the question: What is rails?</p>
  <p>Ruby on Rails (or "Rails") is an open-sourced framework for building powerful web applications. What? Well...ruby on rails is NOT a programming language. Rails is a structure and framework to build web apps using the programming language Ruby. It is a common misconception that rails is a programming language but it is not. Rails can work with multiple types of servers and databases. Rails serves as a framework that follows the DRY convention: Don't Repeat Yourself. Everything in rails is an object, that is why it is considered an object-oriented programming framework. </p>
  <p> The main take-away point of this tech blog is that ruby and ruby on rails are not the same thing. Ruby is a programming language that many web-based applications run off of. The actual framework and background for for that application, however, is powered by Ruby on Rails. Rails is a structure that runs on the ruby programming language and is not considered a language in itself.
