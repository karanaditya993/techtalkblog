  <p>Our dependence on technology is growing every day. Many people rely on technological communication rather than face-to-face contact. The tech world is the new area that scientists, engineers and professionals all around the world are beginning to explore. Advancements in technology have contributed greatly to our society, and there is no doubt that a large percentage of the world's population heavily relies on day-to-day use of technology. However, great leaps forward are always accompanied by small steps back. According to an article written by the Wall Street Journal, the number one issue in the tech industry is that the technology does not always work. Here's why that is an ongoing problem that many scientists and engineers are having trouble approaching and dealing with.</p>
  <p>Because our world is so heavily dependent on the use of technology, if the technology ceases to work the consequences could be dire. It comes as a surprise to many that since we are so involved with technology, why not ensure its safe-keeping and maintanence? Carelessness amongst programmers, developers, engineers and scientists is the reason that many devices and technological advances fall short of their full potential. The world is constantly changing and each and every day there is a new piece of technology that is invented or created. The ways in which we can guarantee the usability and reliability of these creations is to back them up!</p>
