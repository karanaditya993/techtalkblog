    <p>Throughout my life there have been many instances where I have faced conflicts. The biggest conflict that I am currently going through and that is relatable to my everyday life is managing schoolwork and DBC work. This proposes a serious conflict on time-management, and allows me to better practice ways in which I can better, more efficiently use my timee.</p>
    <p>I am currently a student at the University of Wisconsin-Madison in a very demanding civil engineering program. Although I have been able to handle both DBC phase0 work and schoolwork, these past few weeks have been very difficult because of the DBC workload and my final exams. I get scared that I will get left behind in phase 1 because of my inability to have kept up with the work during phase 0. The way in which I handle these types of conflicts is to be honest: both with myself and with the school/DBC staff. If I am having trouble keeping up with the work, I let them know. I let both parties know. And I immediately stray away from cramming and/or not putting in full effort as a result of not having enough. Honesty is key. Be prepared to take on a workload that you know you can finish and put full effort into. If you're having trouble, communicate with others to let them know that you are indeed having trouble with different aspects of your life and workload.</p>
